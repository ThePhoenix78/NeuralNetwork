# NeuralNetwork
*A basic Neural Network made from scratch that does Linear Regression and Genetic Learning*

**Note : This neural network can improve itself by changing the amount of weights/bias and layers with the time**

This is how it looks like when you run the code

**In this case, the AI determined that it only needs one layers of 13 weights to be more efficient**
